        * **Dataset A** consists of $A \in \mathbb{R}^{1000 \times 10000}$ and
        $b \in \mathbb{R}^{1000}$ and is used to evaluate optimizing the least
        square objective function:

                            0.5 * ||Ax - b||^2

        We construct $A$ as follows (matlab code included below): 


        1. initialize $A$ with values drawn independantly from the normal distribution
        $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and add 1 to all its elements; 


            Matlab code:
            ------------

            n=1000; p=10000; bias=1
            X = randn(n, p) + bias

        2. multiply each column in $A$ by a value drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ multiplied by 10;


            Matlab code:
            ------------

            scaling = 10;
            X = X*diag(scaling*randn(p,1));

        3. keep each element in $A$ as non-zero with probability $10 \cdot \log(n)/ n$
        where $n$ is the number of rows in $A$;

            Matlab code:
            ------------

            sparsity = 10;
            X = X .* (rand(n, p) < sparsity * log(n)/n)

        4. Let $w$ be a vector $\in \mathbb{R}^{10000}$ whose elements are drawn from the normal
        distribution $N(0, 1)$. Induce sparsity on $w$ by leaving each element as non-zero with 
        probability 0.1.

            w = randn(p, 1) .* (rand(p,1) < solutionSparsity);

            \begin{equation}
            b = Aw + \epsilon
            \end{equation}
            
            where $\epsilon$ is in $\mathbb{R}^{1000}$ where each entry is drawn
            from $N(0, 1)$.
